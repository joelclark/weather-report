# The Weather Report

This is my submission for the capstone project.  It accepts and validates
a 5 digit integer zip code, and then calls an external service to 
fetch a weather report.  The code was written over the course of about 4 hours, much of which was me fiddling with the output to get it the way I wanted it.
